# Real Estate Blockchain Project
This project is a decentralized real estate platform built on blockchain technology. It allows users to securely buy, sell, and lend properties using smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The project ensures transparency and immutability for real estate transactions, leveraging blockchain's decentralized nature.

## Features
* Property Listings: Users can list properties for sale.
*Transactions: Buy, sell, and lend properties via smart contracts.
* Escrow Mechanism: An escrow system ensures the security of transactions.
* Payment Integration: Payments are made securely through Ethereum smart contracts.
* IPFS Storage: Property data and documents are stored securely using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

## Tools & Technologies Used
* Mocha: A JavaScript testing framework for Node.js, used for unit testing the backend logic.
* Hardhat: A development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. Used for deploying smart contracts to the blockchain.
* Solidity: The programming language used for writing smart contracts.
* Chai: A BDD/TDD assertion library for Node.js and browsers that is used with Mocha for testing.
* IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): Used for decentralized storage of property details and documents, ensuring they are tamper-proof and publicly accessible.
* Ether.js: A library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, enabling smooth communication between the frontend and smart contracts.
