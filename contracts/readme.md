## Inspector:

* An Inspector is a professional who checks the condition of the property before the buyer decides to buy it.

* The inspector looks for any potential issues, like structural problems, plumbing issues, or electrical concerns.

* The property owner may need to allow the inspector to come into the property for a thorough examination.

* The buyer hires the inspector (usually during the home-buying process) to make sure the property is in good condition and that there are no hidden problems.

## Appraiser:

* An Appraiser is a professional who determines the value of the property.

* The appraiser checks things like the propertyâ€™s location, size, condition, and similar properties nearby (comparable sales or "comps") to figure out how much it is worth.

* The lender usually requires an appraisal to make sure that the price the buyer is paying for the property is fair and in line with the market value.

* The buyer might rely on the appraisal to make sure they are not overpaying for the property.
